# Story E-008-14: Design System Figma Library

**Epic:** E-008 – Frontend User Experience & Navigation Overhaul  
**Workstream:** B – Design System & Tokens  
**Priority:** Next  
**Status:** Proposed

## User Story

> As a **designer**, I want **design system Figma library or style guide**, so that **I can design new features with consistent tokens**.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Figma library with design tokens as styles
- [ ] Components (buttons, cards, inputs) built with token styles
- [ ] Color, text, and effect styles match CSS tokens
- [ ] Documentation links Figma tokens to CSS tokens
- [ ] Shared with design and frontend teams

## Implementation Notes

- Designer task (frontend agent may assist with token extraction)
- Ensure Figma tokens sync with CSS tokens

## Deliverables (Designer-focused task)

- Figma library file
- Token mapping documentation

**Note:** This story uses "Deliverables" instead of "Files to Change" because it's a design task rather than code implementation.
